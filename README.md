# SKR-MK3s-V1.4-Beta
Beta SKR V1.4 firmware for the Prusa MK3s Bear


***warning**

I am not held liable for any issues that may arise in this build and can only say that it's worked for me. No warranty is
expressed or given.

If you're converting a stock Prusa MK3s/MK3/MK2.5s/MK2.5 you must realize that this will most likely void your warranty 
from Prusa so be warned that there may be no going back.

Please read through everythign included and I'll hopefully contineu updating this as Marlin releases new updates. The firmware
is stable and works great. I've enabled every feature I could think possible and included a Wiring guide and a cheat sheet for 
editing the firmware for your personal needs. 

Have fun and happy printing!
