# SKR-MK3s-V1.4-Beta
Beta SKR V1.4 firmware for the Prusa MK3s Bear


*****warning*****

I am not held liable for any issues that may arise in this build and can only say that it's worked for me. No warranty is
expressed or given.

If you're converting a stock Prusa MK3s/MK3/MK2.5s/MK2.5 you must realize that this will most likely void your warranty 
from Prusa so be warned that there may be no going back.

*****warning*****

Please read through everything included and I'll hopefully continue updating this as Marlin releases new updates. The firmware
is stable and works great. I've enabled every feature I could think possible and included a Wiring guide and a cheat sheet for 
editing the firmware for your personal needs. 

Have fun and happy printing!
